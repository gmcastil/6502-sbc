My primary goal is to develop a 65C02 based single
board computer with the following functionality:
- Capability to instrument important signals with an Arduino using simple pin
  headers.
- LED, seven-segment display, an LCD display
- UART interface
- Very simple address decode logic, particularly for the Mark Zero
- External 5VDC

Here are the sub skills I'm identifying:
- Circuit design of the board
- Build protoype on breadboard
- Programming and software development
- Kicad schematic capture
- Kicad layout and board design
- Kicad BOM and board file generation
- Work with board house and Mouser to obtain components and boards
- Assembly of board
- Debug of assembled board

This is basically the beginning of that process.  I'm going to try to use Kicad
to create up to date schematics of what I have on the breadboard as I go and
then eventually that should become what is made by the board house.

The first step is to draw up what I've got on the board now and then debug it
and figure out why I'm seeing gibberish on the monitored outputs.
