My primary goal is to develop a 65C02 based single
board computer with the following functionality:
- Capability to instrument important signals with an Arduino using simple pin
  headers.
- LED, seven-segment display, an LCD display
- UART interface
- Very simple address decode logic, particularly for the Mark Zero
- External 5VDC

Here are the sub skills I'm identifying:
- Circuit design of the board
- Build protoype on breadboard
- Programming and software development
- Kicad schematic capture
- Kicad layout and board design
- Kicad BOM and board file generation
- Work with board house and Mouser to obtain components and boards
- Assembly of board
- Debug of assembled board

This is basically the beginning of that process.  I'm going to try to use Kicad
to create up to date schematics of what I have on the breadboard as I go and
then eventually that should become what is made by the board house.

The first step is to draw up what I've got on the board now and then debug it
and figure out why I'm seeing gibberish on the monitored outputs.

I discovered that if I use GNU screen and just clear it, I can more or less use
my serial port monitor as a logic analyzer.  That's nice.

But for reasons I don't quite understand yet, I cannot seem to get the data
lines to get instrumented as 0xEA.  I'm starting to think I might have the pin
numbering backwards or something.  So I might just use the same pin numbers and
mappings and try to just poll some constant values on those GPIO pins.  Make
sure that I can actually read the values.  Yeah, that's actually the simplest
thing to do - make sure I can actually read what I think I'm reading.

Let's talk address decoding.  For the first iteration of the baord, I want
something simple. So, 16KB of RAM, 32KB of ROM, and then put IO in between

The address map should look something like
